## E Dice using RNG or STM32F4
A simple project written in Embedded C that makes use of the Random Number Generator Module to generate numbers between 1-6 and display them as dice patterns on an I2C OLED Display

To use
1. Connect the Display to I2C1 port of the STM32F4 Board.
2. Connect a push button to GPIOA Pin 0
3. Press the button to roll the dice and show a face on    the OLED Screen
